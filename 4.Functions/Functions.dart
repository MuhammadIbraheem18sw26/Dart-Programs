  // calling a function

  /**
  * Return type: This comes first; it tells you immediately what
the type will be of the function output. This particular
function will return a String, but your functions can return
any type you like. If the function won’t return anything,
that is, if it performs some work but doesn’t produce an
output value, you can use void as return type.


Function name: You can name functions almost anything
you like, but you should follow the lowerCamelCase naming
convention.

Parameters: Parameters are the input to the function; they
go inside the parentheses after the function name. This
example has only one parameter, but if you had more than
one, you would separate them with commas. For each
parameter, you write the type first, followed by the name.
Just as with variable names, you should use lowerCamelCase
for your parameter names.

Return value: This is the function’s output, and it should
match the return type. In the example above, the function
returns a String value by using the return keyword. If the
return type is void, though, then you don’t return anything.


The return type, function name and parameters are collectively
known as the function signature. The code between the braces
is known as the function body.
